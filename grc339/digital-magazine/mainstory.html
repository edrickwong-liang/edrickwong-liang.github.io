                    <h2>Gia Fu Traces the Cross-Cultural Rhythms of Salsa Music</h2>
                            <!-- Include filler texts, images, and captions as indicated in the content file. -->
                    <p>Salsa music has opened the world up to musician and DJ Gia Fu. More people know about Fu in New York City than in her hometown of Hong Kong. More of Fu’s social media followers speak Spanish and English than Cantonese or Mandarin. And before she began filling venues in Hong Kong with her unique and enchanting vinyl mixes that “bridge cultural gaps and celebrate diversity through Salsa, Afro-Latin music, and Asian sounds” under her series “Canton Mambo,” Fu was already a global bonafide star in the world of Latin music.</p>
                    <p>In 2021, Fu produced a full-length salsa album featuring Grammy nominee Angel Meléndez. In the same year, she became the first Asian woman to tour as a Latin music DJ. In 2022, she signed with Marc Anthony’s talent agency MagnusMedia. In the past two years, Fu has completed several major tours around the US, Europe, and Latin America. She has played Glastonbury Festival, Lincoln Center, and El Museo del Barrio as a guest artist celebrating the 60th anniversary of the legendary salsa record label Fania. All the while, her Youtube salsa mixes have garnered millions of views.</p>

                      <p>
                        After traversing the globe, this past October, Fu decided to make New York City, the birthplace of salsa, her home.

                      <p>
                        Here, at a Caribbean percussion workshop, she connected with a community of Chinese Cuban women in their 60s and 70s. Her newest single, “Lotus,” is largely inspired by them. “There are lots of Cuban Chinese or Peruvian Chinese restaurants in New York that make this community feel at home—why isn’t there something music-wise?” Fu told me. “I’d love to do something for them and make the kind of music that they could relate to, in the form of salsa or Latin music while bringing together instruments from their roots.”

                        Emblematic of Fu’s signature cross-cultural style, “Lotus” is an even bolder blend of Chinese and Latin influences. Trained as a Chinese folk dancer, Fu began her adventures weaving the traditional Chinese instrument, guzheng, into a full-set salsa orchestra with her first single “Canton Mambo” released in 2023. With “Lotus,” Fu pushes her experiment further, incorporating Chinese percussion, string instruments, and familiar melodic arrangements reminiscent of the unique sounds of China’s southwest. While introducing rich Chinese instrumentation in the single, Fu maintains the form and structure of salsa.
